### Project Description
Let's Procrastinate with a purpose!
ProcrastiNation is a humorous productivity app that alternates between serious and silly tasks to keep users motivated and entertained. Just when you're on a roll with your productivity, ProcrastiNation will surprise you with an amusingly pointless task to keep things... unpredictable!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too much productivity can be boring! Staying on track with a to-do list can feel like a drag, so why not sprinkle some fun into it?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
ProcrastiNation interjects random "silly tasks" between productive tasks. For every productive task completed, you‚Äôll be given a lighthearted ‚Äúsilly task‚Äù that makes absolutely no sense but keeps you laughing!

## Technical Details
